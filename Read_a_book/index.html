    <h1>Beauty and the Beast</h1>
    <div id="text">
        <p>Once upon a time there was a very rich man who lived with his three daughters.  
        The two older daughters laughed at anyone who did not dress as well as they did.  
        If they were not going to a ball, they were shopping for as many fine dresses and 
        hats as they could carry home.</p> 

        <p>The youngest daughter, Beauty, liked to read most of all.  
        “No one will want you!” her two older sisters said, and they laughed.  
        “Look at your hair - you look like a servant girl!”  Beauty did not know why they 
        talked to her in a mean way.  But she said nothing.</p>

        <p>One day, the father got some very bad news.  He had spent all of his money on a ship 
        that he sent out to sea for trade.  Now he learned that the ship was gone.  Everything 
        on it was lost!  All at once, the rich father became as poor as poor could be.</p> 

        <p>The family could no longer stay in their big house.  The house, its fine tables and chairs, 
        and all of their fine things, had to be sold.</p>

        <p>All the father had left was a little hut deep in the woods.  So that is where he and his three 
        daughters had to move.  Living in the hut in the woods was hard work.  Each day a fire had to 
        be started, meals cooked, the place cleaned up, the garden tended, and things fixed when they 
        broke.  Now that the family was poor, you might think the two older sisters would help out with 
        the chores.  Think again.</p>
